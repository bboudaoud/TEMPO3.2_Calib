This sample calibration session was generated by Anish sometime in March

The two files:
33RPM_node116.csv and 45RPM_node116.csv contain session data stored as CSVs with the first row the CSV corresponding to the time (in seconds from the start of the session) at which the sample was taken.

These files were used to test the quality of use of a linear fit for gyro calibration. The affiliated correction scheme, included in calibplot.m plots the quality of the results for 33 and 45 RPM data sets.
